# Win10Tweaker


Graphical app for adjusting Windows 10 settings that otherwise aren't exposed by Windows. I was getting annoyed at having to look these settings up every time I wanted to adjust them so here we are.

Currently supported settings:
* Disable/Enable Cortana
* Disable/Enable Bing/Web Start Menu Search
